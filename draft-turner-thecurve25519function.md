# Introduction

This document specifies the Curve25519 function, an ECDH
(Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman) key-agreement scheme for use in
cryptographic applications.  It was designed with performance and
security in mind.  This document is based on information in the
public domain.

This document provides a stable reference for the Curve25519 function
{{Curve25519}} to which other specifications may refer when defining
their use of Curve25519.  It specifies how to use Curve25519 for
key exchange.  This document defines the algorithm, the "wire format"
(how to serialize and parse bytes sent over a network, for example),
and provides some implementation guidance to avoid known side-channel
timing exposures.

This document does not specify the use of Curve25519 in any other
specific protocol, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) or IPsec
(Internet Protocol Security).  It does not specify how to use
Curve25519 for digital signatures.

Readers are assumed to be familiar with the concepts of elliptic
curves, modular arithmetic, group operations, and finite fields
{{RFC6090}} as well as rings {{Curve25519}}.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

# Notation and Definitions

The following notation and definitions are used in this document
(notation is to the left of the ":"):

A: A value used in the elliptic-curve equation E.

E: An elliptic-curve equation.

p: A prime.

GF(p): The field with p elements.

_#: Subscript notation, where # is a number or letter.

=: Assignment.

^: Exponentiation.

+, -, *, /: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively.

Note that all operations are performed modulo p.

# The Curve25519 Function

Let p = 2^255 - 19.  Let E be the elliptic curve with the equation y^2 =
x^3 + 486662 * x^2 + x over GF(p).

Each element x of GF(p) has a unique little-endian representation
as 32 bytes x\[0\] ... x\[31\], such that x\[0\] + 256 * x\[1\] + 256^2 *
x\[2\] + ... + 256^31 * x\[31\] is congruent to x modulo p, and x\[31\]
is minimal. Implementations MUST only produce points in this form.
On receiving a point, implementations MUST mask the leftmost bit of byte
31 to zero.  This is done to preserve compatibility with point formats
which reserve the sign bit for use in other protocols and increase
resistance to implementation fingerprinting.  Implementations MUST
reject numbers in the range \[2^255-19, 2^255-1\], inclusive.

Let X denote the projection map from a point (x,y) on E, to x, extended
so that X of the point at infinity is zero.  X is surjective onto
GF(p) if the y coordinate takes on values in GF(p) and in a quadratic
extension of GF(p).

Then Curve25519(s, X(Q)) = X(sQ) is a function defined for all integers
s and elements X(Q) of GF(p). Proper implementations use a restricted
set of integers for s and only x-coordinates of points Q defined over
GF(p). The remainder of this document describes how to compute this
function quickly and securely, and use it in a Diffie-Hellman scheme.

# Implementing the Curve25519 Function

Let s be a 255 bits long integer, where  
s = sum s_i * 2^i with s_i in {0, 1}. 

Computing Curve25519(s, x)  is done by the following procedure,
taken from {{Curve25519}} based on formulas from {{Mont}}. All
calculations are performed in GF(p), i.e., they are performed modulo
p. The parameter a24 is a24 = (486662 - 2) / 4 = 121665.

~~~~~~~~~~
    x_1 = x
    x_2 = 0
    z_2 = 1
    x_3 = x
    z_3 = 1
    For t = 254 down to 0:
        // Conditional swap; see text below.
	(x_2, x_3) = cswap (s_t, x_2, x_3)
	(z_2, z_3) = cswap (s_t, z_2, z_3)
        A = x_2 + z_2
        AA = A^2
        B = x_2 - z_2
        BB = B^2
        E = AA - BB
        C = x_3 + z_3
        D = x_3 - z_3
        DA = D * A
        CB = C * B
        x_3 = (DA + CB)^2
        z_3 = x_1 * (DA - CB)^2
        x_2 = AA * BB
        z_2 = E * (AA + a24 * E)
        // Conditional swap; see text below.
	(x_2, x_3) = cswap (s_t, x_2, x_3)
	(z_2, z_3) = cswap (s_t, z_2, z_3)
    Return x_2 * (z_2^(p - 2))
~~~~~~~~~~

In implementing this procedure, due to the existence of side-channels
in commodity hardware, it is important that the pattern of memory accesses
and jumps not depend on the values of any of the bits of s.
It is also important that the arithmetic used not leak information about 
the integers modulo p (such as having b * c distinguishable from c * c).

The cswap instruction SHOULD be implemented in constant time (independent 
of s_t) as follows:

	cswap(s_t, x_2, x_3)
	      dummy = s_t * (x_2 - x_3)
	      x_2 = x_2 - dummy
	      x_3 = x_3 + dummy
	Return (x_2, x_3)

where s_t is 1 or 0. Alternatively, an implementation MAY use the
following:

      dummy = mask(s_t) AND (x_2 XOR x_3)
      x_2 = x_2 XOR dummy
      x_3 = x_3 XOR dummy

where mask(s_t) is the all-1 or all-0 word of the same length as x_2
and x_3, computed, e.g., as 
      mask(s_t) = 0 - s_t.
The latter version is often more efficient.

# Use of the Curve25519 function

The Curve25519 function can be used in an ECDH protocol as follows:

Alice generates 32 random bytes in f\[0\] to f\[31\]. She masks the
three rightmost bits of f\[0\] and the leftmost bit of f\[31\] to zero
and sets the second leftmost bit of f\[31\] to 1. This means that f is
of the form 2^254 + 8 * {0, 1, ..., 2^(251) - 1} as a little-endian
integer.

Alice then transmits K_A = Curve25519(f, 9) to Bob, where 9 is the
number 9.

Bob similarly generates 32 random bytes in g\[0\] to g\[31\],
applies the same masks,
computes K_B = Curve25519(g, 9) and transmits it to Alice.

Alice computes Curve25519(f, Curve25519(g, 9)); Bob computes
Curve25519(g, Curve25519(f, 9)) using their generated values and the
received input.

Both of them now share K = Curve25519(f, Curve25519(g, 9)) =
Curve25519(g, Curve25519(f, 9)) as a shared secret.  Alice and Bob can
then use a key-derivation function, such as hashing K, to compute a
key.

# Test Vectors

The following test vectors are taken from {{NaCl}}. All numbers are
shown as little-endian hexadecimal byte strings:

Alice's private key, f:

     77 07 6d 0a 73 18 a5 7d 3c 16 c1 72 51 b2 66 45
     df 4c 2f 87 eb c0 99 2a b1 77 fb a5 1d b9 2c 2a

Alice's public key, Curve25519(f, 9):

     85 20 f0 09 89 30 a7 54 74 8b 7d dc b4 3e f7 5a
     0d bf 3a 0d 26 38 1a f4 eb a4 a9 8e aa 9b 4e 6a

Bob's private key, g:

     5d ab 08 7e 62 4a 8a 4b 79 e1 7f 8b 83 80 0e e6
     6f 3b b1 29 26 18 b6 fd 1c 2f 8b 27 ff 88 e0 eb

Their shared secret, K:

     4a 5d 9d 5b a4 ce 2d e1 72 8e 3b f4 80 35 0f 25
     e0 7e 21 c9 47 d1 9e 33 76 f0 9b 3c 1e 16 17 42

# Security Considerations

Curve25519 meets all standard assumptions on DH and DLP difficulty.

In addition, Curve25519 is twist secure: the co-factor of the curve
is 8, that of the twist is 4. Protocols that require contributory
behavior must ban outputs K_A = 0, K_B = 0 or K = 0.

Curve25519 is designed to enable very high performance software
implementations, thus reducing the cost of highly secure cryptography
to a point where it can be used more widely.

Curve25519 can be generated in the following manner: Let p=2^255-19, and
consider the elliptic curve y^2=x^3+ux^2+x for various choices of u. Then 486662
is the minimum u congruent to 2 (mod 4) such that the order of the curve is 8 times a prime
and the order of the twist is 4 times a prime.

The prime 2^255-19 was selected to enable highly efficent arithmetic across a wide range of platforms.
Few primes of the form 2^c-s with s small exist between 2^250 and 2^521, and other choices of coefficient are not
as competitive in performance.
